# [CASE SIMULATOR](https://carlos4152.github.io/Case-Simulator/)

## Description

1. This simulator enables you to register cases related to customers' products or services.

2. It keeps a history of all the cases that the CSR (Customer Service Representative) has registered.

 3. It allows you to delete and search for a specific case by the customer's name. 

## Why did you decided to build this project?

I've noticed that many people are building the same applications, and honestly, I've always wanted to make a difference. Additionally, I used to work as a Bilingual Customer Services Representative, and I always wanted to learn how to fix the platforms and systems I used at work. Plus, I've always wanted to create my own website! üòÅ
